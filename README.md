# Road-Accident-Data
In this project, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyse road accident data across different factors such as location, vehicle type, road conditions, and time of day. The dashboard highlights key KPIs like total casualties, severity breakdowns, and accident trends between urban and rural areas.
